## Why?

Experts have said that blogging about Data Science <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/can-blogging-about-data-science-really-get-you-hired-as-a-data-scientist-7f02fec085ec" target="_blank">can get you a job</a>.  But writing a blog can be intimidating to a new, aspiring blogger.  How to get started?  How do I write it?  What do I even write about?  All of these uncertainties can be paralyzing enough to prevent you from even trying.  However, I have good news-ChatGPT can help.  The cutting-edge machine-learning chatbot can be a fantastic source for aid.

## How?

Using ChatGPT is very easy.  All you have to do is log in at <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI's site</a> and start chatting away.  For example, ChatGPT can be very useful for answering syntax questions:
'''
**Me:** "I am writting a blog about using chatgpt to help blogging.  How can I make responses to example questions I ask you look like they come from you?"

**ChatGPT:**To format text in markdown, you can use various syntax elements. For example, to make text bold, you can use double asterisks or double underscores like `**bold**` or `__bold__`. Similarly, to make text italic, you can use single asterisks or single underscores like `*italic*` or `_italic_`. There are many other formatting options available in markdown as well.
'''
It gave me several other suggestions even on top of those.  I will be using the same formatting as above for the rest of this blog, using text chunks to separate conversations with ChatGPT and clearly demarking who is speaking.
