## The Question
The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the outcome of a college football game while it is still in progress.  More details can be found on my <a href="https://csthomps.github.io/s386-blog/2023/11/05/386-project-part-1.html" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, but in summary the data I am using is a combination of data from <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/" target="_blank">CBS Sport's Site</a> and methods from <a href="http://www.glicko.net/research/nfl-chapter.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> by Mark Glickman and Hal Stern.

## EDA
Before doing any sort of statistical modeling, it is always important to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA).  EDA helps a statistician to understand the data so they can work with it correctly.  The code for all the plots I will show can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/csthomps/s386-project/blob/main/visualization.ipynb" target="_blank">github repo</a> for the project.

First, I want to understand the distribution of the response variable, the final differential of the games.  As a reminder, differentials are calculated as the home team's score minus the away team's score, so if it is positive then the home team is winning and vice versa.
